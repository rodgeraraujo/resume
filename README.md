# Résumé d'rodger

This is my Résumé generator. You can check out in [here](https://resume.rogerioaraujo.dev).

## How it works

- The data is hosted by [Gist](https://gist.github.com/rodgeraraujo/cdd4ce46e60f72213fa68a97e7d513b6) with [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard.
- The website is hosted by [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) with CI/CD.
- HTML is generated with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and PDF is printed with [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/).
